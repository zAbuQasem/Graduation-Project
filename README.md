# Vulnerable Linux Server
As a CTF players and infosec geeks we decided to make this server as our graduation project!
## What will you learn?
1. Exploit LFI to read arbitary files.
2. Take advantage of weak password policies.
3. Exploiting a wildcard injection.
4. Systemd services.
5. Docker containers and mounts.

## Setting up the environment
[TODO]
